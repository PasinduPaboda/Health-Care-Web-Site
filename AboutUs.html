					<h1>The History of the Hospital</h1>
					<p> Upon encouragement from the government and community, in 1888, the Sisters decided to open
						a hospital. On October 15, 1888, Health care Hospital was officially opened, initially with 10 beds
						and space to accommodate 24 patients in total. The staff consisted of three Sisters and four
						doctors.
						</br>
						It was out of this humble beginning and the mission of the Sisters that Health care Hospital and
						all its affiliated services grew. Indeed, the hospital continues to provide the type of care that was
						initiated and nurtured by the Sisters, in the tradition of faith and caring.
						</br>
						Today, Health care retains its close affiliation with the Sisters through its owner, Health Care
						Society of London

					<h1>We are the world's largest Hospital</h1>
					<p> An acute care hospital provides short-term inpatient care for patients with injuries or short-term
						illnesses who are ideally expected to fully recover and return to normal levels of activity upon
						release. The staff of physicians and nurses at an acute care hospital can diagnose and treat a
						wide range of conditions via medical intervention, both surgical and non-surgical. A patient may
						stay in an acute care hospital for a surgery and the necessary aftercare, to deliver a baby and
						receive postnatal care, or for a wide range of additional illnesses or injuries that require medical
						attention and monitoring during treatment and recovery. The vast majority (91%) of hospitals
						in the U.S. are acute care facilities, meaning they are equipped for short-term treatment as
						opposed to long-term care. Most acute care patients are hospitalized for less than ten days.
