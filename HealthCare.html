					<h1>Importance of Health</h1>
					<p>
						Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being. For a healthy life cycle,
						a person needs to have a balanced diet and has to regularly exercise. One must also live in a
						proper shelter, take enough sleep and have good hygiene habits. So, how do we ensure that
						we are doing all the right things to have a good health? Let’s spread the awareness for the
						importance of health:
					</p>
					<p>
						The health of all organisms depends on their surrounding or their environment. Our social
						environment is an important factor in our individual health.
					</p>
					<p>
						Public cleanliness is important for individual health. Therefore, we must ensure that we collect
						and clear the garbage regularly. We must also contact an agency who can take the responsibility
						of clearing the drains. Without this, you could severely affect your health.
					</p>
					<p>
						We need food for health and for food, we will have to earn money by doing work. For this, the
						opportunity to do work has to be available. Good economic condition and jobs are, therefore,
						needed for individual health
					</p>
					<p>
						We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy. If we mistreat each other and are afraid of each
						other, we cannot be healthy or happy. Social equality and harmony are important for individual
						health.
